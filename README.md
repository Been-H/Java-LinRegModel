# Java-LinRegModel
This is a simple linear regression model written in java that uses creates a line of best fit or "least-squares line." It does this by using a formula to find the line that minimizes the sum of the sqaures of the vertical distances of each data point inputted and the line. You can find more information here: https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-by-hand-ee7fe5a751bf.

This program has two sigma function for calculating the different sigmas of the input data using method overloading. It uses these to calculate the line of best fit and assings the slope and y-intercept values to be used for the pedict method. This was really fun to make and I might make more models like this in the future.
